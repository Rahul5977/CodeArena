# üîß Judge0 API Key Fix

## Issue

Code execution was failing with:

```
401 Unauthorized from Judge0 API
500 Internal Server Error
```

## Root Cause

The `SULU_API_KEY` in `/backend/.env` was **invalid or expired**.

## Solution

### Updated Backend .env

Changed from:
```bash
SULU_API_KEY=<old-invalid-key>  # ‚ùå Invalid
```

To:
```bash
SULU_API_KEY=<new-valid-key>  # ‚úÖ Valid
```

### Verification

Tested the new key directly with Judge0:
```bash
curl -X POST https://judge0-ce.p.sulu.sh/submissions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -d '{"source_code":"print(\"hello\")", "language_id":71}'
```

Result: ‚úÖ `{"token":"<token-id>"}`

## Backend Restarted

- Killed old process on port 8080
- Started fresh backend with new API key
- Backend responding correctly

## Test Now

1. **Refresh your browser** (http://localhost:3001)
2. **Navigate to any problem**
3. **Write simple code:**
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
4. **Click "Run Code"**
5. **Should work! ‚úÖ**

## Status

‚úÖ **Fixed and Ready to Test**
