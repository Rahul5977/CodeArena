npm --version

# Check Docker (optional but recommended)
docker --version
```

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Start backend server
npm run dev
```

Backend should be running on `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables
# Create .env file with:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
# VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080
# VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY=your_test_key

# Start frontend server
npm run dev
```

Frontend should be running on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Verify Setup

- [ ] Backend accessible at http://localhost:8080

## 💡 Pro Tips for Fast Development

### 1. Use AI Assistants

- GitHub Copilot for code completion
- ChatGPT/Claude for complex logic
- Use AI to generate boilerplate code

### 2. Copy-Paste Smart

- Reuse component patterns from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Modify existing components

### 3. Test as You Build

- Don't wait till end to test
- Test each feature immediately
- Fix bugs before moving on

### 4. Use DaisyUI Components

- Don't build from scratch
- Use pre-built components
- Customize with Tailwind classes

### 5. Focus on Core First

- Complete critical path first (auth, problem solve, submit)
- Add polish later
- Working > Beautiful (for now)

### 6. Leverage Browser DevTools

- React DevTools for debugging
- Network tab for API calls
- Console for errors

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: CORS Errors

**Solution:** Backend has CORS configured for `http://localhost:3000`. Make sure frontend runs on this port.

### Issue 2: JWT Token Expiry

**Solution:** Implement token refresh logic using `/auth/refresh` endpoint

### Issue 3: Monaco Editor Not Loading

**Solution:**

```jsx
import { Editor } from "@monaco-editor/react";
// Use lazy loading
const CodeEditor = lazy(() => import("./components/CodeEditor"));
```

### Issue 4: Socket.IO Connection Fails

**Solution:** Check VITE_WS_URL env variable, ensure backend is running

### Issue 5: Payment Testing

**Solution:** Use Razorpay test mode with test cards from their docs

### Issue 6: Database Connection

**Solution:** Ensure PostgreSQL is running, check DATABASE_URL in .env
