## 🛠️ Development Tips

### Daily Routine:

1. **Start with backend verification** (10 min)

   - Test API endpoints for the day's features
   - Check database connections
   - Verify Socket.IO if needed

2. **Component-first approach** (80% of time)

   - Build UI components first
   - Add state management
   - Integrate API calls
   - Handle loading/error states

3. **Testing before moving on** (10% of time)
   - Test each feature before moving to next
   - Fix bugs immediately
   - Document any known issues

### Code Quality:

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and reusable
- Follow DRY principle
- Use custom hooks for repeated logic

### Git Workflow:

- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Create feature branches for major features
- Merge to main after testing
- Tag releases (v1.0.0-beta, v1.0.0)

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers:

1. **Judge0 API Issues**

   - Backup: Use local code runner or alternative service
   - Have test data ready

2. **Payment Gateway Testing**

   - Use Razorpay test mode
   - Have test cards ready

3. **Socket.IO Connection Issues**

   - Implement fallback polling mechanism
   - Add reconnection logic

4. **Monaco Editor Performance**
   - Lazy load the editor
   - Use web workers if needed

### Contingency Plans:

- If a feature is too complex: Use simplified version, mark as v2.0
- If API issues: Use local mock data temporarily
- If time runs out: Prioritize P0 features, defer P1 features

---

## 📈 Post-Launch Roadmap (v2.0)

### Features for Future:

- [ ] Discuss/Comments section for problems
- [ ] Social features (follow users, share solutions)
- [ ] Achievements and badges system
- [ ] AI-powered problem recommendations
- [ ] Video solution tutorials
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] IDE integration (VS Code extension)
- [ ] Company-wise problem filtering
- [ ] Interview preparation tracks
- [ ] Peer code review system

---

## 💡 Final Notes

This plan is aggressive but achievable with focused 4-5 hour sessions. The key is to:

1. **Start immediately** - Don't overthink, start building
2. **Test continuously** - Don't accumulate technical debt
3. **Stay focused** - Avoid feature creep
4. **Ask for help** - Use AI assistants, documentation, and communities
5. **Celebrate wins** - Acknowledge daily progress

Remember: **Done is better than perfect**. Ship a working product, then iterate based on user feedback.

**Let's build something amazing! 🚀**
