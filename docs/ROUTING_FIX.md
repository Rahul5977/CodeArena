# Routing Fix - Dashboard Navigation

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Issue: Dashboard Not Visible from Navbar

### Problem:

When clicking "Dashboard" in the navbar, users were being redirected to the Home page instead of the Dashboard page. This was because:

- The navbar linked to `/` with label "Dashboard"
- The route `/` was showing the `Home` component
- The actual `Dashboard` component was at `/dashboard`

### Solution:

Replaced the Home page with Dashboard at the root route `/`:

**Before:**

```jsx
// Route "/" showed Home component
<Route path="/" element={<ProtectedRoute><Home /></ProtectedRoute>} />

// Dashboard was at "/dashboard"
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<ProtectedRoute><Layout /></ProtectedRoute>}>
  <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
</Route>
```

**After:**

```jsx
// Route "/" now shows Dashboard component with Layout
<Route
  path="/"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <Layout />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
>
  <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
</Route>

// "/dashboard" route removed (no longer needed)
```

### Files Modified:

- `frontend/src/App.jsx`
  - Removed `Home` import
  - Changed root route `/` to render `Dashboard` component inside `Layout`
  - Removed duplicate `/dashboard` route

### Impact:

- ✅ Clicking "Dashboard" in navbar now correctly shows the Dashboard page
- ✅ Root route `/` shows Dashboard (consistent with navbar)
- ✅ Removed unused Home component from routing
- ✅ Cleaner routing structure
- ✅ No breaking changes to other routes

### Testing:

1. Navigate to `/` - should show Dashboard
2. Click "Dashboard" in navbar - should show Dashboard
3. All other navbar links should work as before
4. Login should redirect to `/` which now shows Dashboard

### Notes:

- The `Home.jsx` component file still exists but is no longer used in routing
- Can be deleted in future cleanup if not needed elsewhere
- All protected routes now use the `Layout` component for consistent UI

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested
