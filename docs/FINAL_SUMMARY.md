### Component Patterns

**Glassmorphism Card:**

<div className="bg-slate-900/80 backdrop-blur-xl rounded-2xl border border-white/10 p-6 shadow-2xl">
```

**Gradient Button:**

```jsx
<button className="px-6 py-3 bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-500 to-pink-500 hover:from-teal-600 hover:to-pink-600 text-white font-semibold rounded-xl transition-all">
```

## 🎓 How to Extend This Design

### Adding a New Page

1. Copy the animated background section from any existing page
2. Use standard card components: `bg-slate-900/80 backdrop-blur-xl...`
3. Apply gradient text to headings: `bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-400 to-pink-400...`
4. Use consistent buttons and inputs
5. Add Framer Motion animations

### Customizing Colors

All colors use Tailwind classes. To change:

- Replace `teal-*` → your primary color
- Replace `pink-*` → your secondary color
- Update all gradient definitions
- Test contrast ratios

### Performance Tips

- Keep particles at ~30 per page
- Use `pointer-events-none` on decorative elements
- Limit backdrop-blur to visible cards
- Profile with Chrome DevTools
