## 🔌 API Integration

### Current Endpoints Used

```javascript
GET / api / v1 / submissions; // Fetch user submissions
GET / api / v1 / problem; // Fetch all problems
```

### Data Processing (Client-Side)

All calculations are done client-side for now:

- **Solved Count:** Unique `problemId` from Accepted submissions
- **Total Submissions:** Count all submissions
- **Streak:** Consecutive days with submissions
- **Activity Data:** Group submissions by date
- **Recommended Problems:** Filter unsolved problems

### Future Backend Endpoints (Recommended)

```javascript
GET / api / v1 / user / stats; // Pre-calculated stats
GET / api / v1 / submissions / recent; // Recent submissions only
GET / api / v1 / problems / recommended; // ML-based recommendations
GET / api / v1 / user / activity; // Pre-aggregated activity data
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- ✅ API failures handled gracefully with `Promise.allSettled`
- ✅ Fallback to empty arrays on error
- ✅ Toast notifications for critical errors
- ✅ Graceful degradation (show available data)
- ✅ Loading indicators prevent UI jank

---

## 📱 Accessibility

- ✅ Semantic HTML structure
- ✅ ARIA labels for icons
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus states on all interactive elements
- ✅ Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- ✅ Screen reader friendly

---

## 🔒 Authentication

- ✅ Dashboard is **protected route** (redirects to `/login` if not authenticated)
- ✅ Integrates with existing Zustand auth store
- ✅ Uses `useAuthStore()` for user data
- ✅ Fetches data only for authenticated users
